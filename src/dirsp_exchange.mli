(** For securing a conversation between two or more parties.

    {1 Summary}

    Dirsp is a short form for Diskuv Implementations of Research Security Protocols.
    The [dirsp-exchange] library has implementations of protocols published in the research
    field of the authenticated exchange of messages. It uses a [dirsp-proscript] library
    like [dirsp-proscript-mirage] to provide a runtime library of cryptographic primitives.

    At the moment this library is a no-op. The [dirsp-exchange-kbb2017] library is the first
    implementation of a secure two party protocol.
