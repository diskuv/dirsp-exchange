description: """\
Dirsp is a short form for Diskuv Implementations of Research Security Protocols.
The [dirsp-exchange] library is a no-op as of May 2021, but will have high-level
APIs that can stitch together the sub-libraries like [dirsp-exchange-kbb2017].
These [dirsp-exchange-*] sublibraries are implementations of research/academic
protocols published in the field of authenticated message exchange."""
